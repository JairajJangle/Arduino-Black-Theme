## Installation

### Mac OS

Look in `~/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back). If this folder is not visible, Right click `~/Applications/Arduino` â†’ Show Package Contents.

### Windows

Look in your Arduino installation forder eg: `C:\Program Files(x86)\Arduino\lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back).

### Linux 

Look in your Arduino installatio forder eg: `/home/user_name/Arduino/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## You can create your own theme

Edit the `theme.txt` file, an XML file inside the syntax folder, and the button files. Unfortunately, not all items in the theme.txt file actually work, so if you can't get an item to change, try another one of the files.

Thanks to https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkArduinoTheme for dark theme of arduino, I have modified this theme to total black theme, this looks great on OLED screens.
