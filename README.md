## Installation

### Mac OS

Look in `~/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back). If this folder is not visible, Right click `~/Applications/Arduino` â†’ Show Package Contents.

### Windows

Look in your Arduino installation forder eg: `C:\Program Files(x86)\Arduino\lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back).

### Linux 

Look in your Arduino installation forder eg: `/home/user_name/Arduino/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (make a copy of the original in case you want to revert back).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## You can create your own theme

Before playing with the theme files do not forget to take a backup of the theme folder.

Edit the _theme.txt_ file, _.xml_ files inside the _syntax_ folder and the image files.

Unfortunately, for me, not all the changes done in the _theme.txt_ file got reflected in the Arduino IDE, so if you can't get a style to be applied, try making changes in other files.

Thanks to https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkArduinoTheme for the inspiration.
